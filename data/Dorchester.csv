Bus routes scheduled for say, every 12 minutes (e.g. the pitful Route 23) don't cycle faster than every 30-45 minutes (or more). Meanwhile busses sit at both terminals and drive through without stopping.  Granted, delays happen. But when there is chronic dysfunction and public feedback has no impact (specific emails and calls to Transit Authority), the problem is the 'system' or lack of a system. I've spoken to terminal 'Inspector' supervisors who say that one problem is that they are often hamstrung by the schedulers who pull busses out from under their control.  Passengers who have paid for a transportation system are left without reliable transportation.

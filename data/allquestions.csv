Because the MBTA does not reach far enough, runs too slow, and is poorly kept. And I'd like the subway to be faster than me biking. I think the Tokyo subway system serves as a good model here. (Except extended hours are necessary in a city where everything closes - I can't go out for an entire night here.)   And on the subject of bikeability- can we get rid of buses in favor of bike lanes and expanded subway systems? I know there are a lot of arguments for buses but as a biker and a driver I feel like they are the single largest threat to city driving/biking, as well as the cause of lots of traffic congestion with their frequent stops and large size. The number of times I've been almost hit by a bus driver while biking is ridiculous- it outstrips the number of near misses with cars by an order of magnitude.  And street sweeping. Stop it? All it does is create a parking nightmare for residents.  And snow removal, in light of the recent blizzard- I don't know what the solution is to this exactly, but there isn't anywhere for many residents to shovel it to. It needs to be actually removed from the street entirely at some point, instead of just being piled up on the curb to ice over and block parking spots until spring.  ",Access

Each stop adds about 5 minutes to the commute (x2 per day = 10 minutes; x5 days is about an hour, x52 weeks is something like 52 hours), or 2 full days - of a person's life sitting at a stop they will never get on or off from. Multiply that by about ten stops and the poor commuter will have literally wasted TWO WEEKS OF THEIR LIFE in any given year waiting for people to get on or off at a stop they will NEVER utilize.    So, if anything, it might make more sense and add efficiency to REDUCE the number of stops any subway or rail line makes - especially when there are two stops less than a Frisbee's throw away from one another.

For instance, Finland. Here is a description of their rail network:  ""Once you’re in Finland, trains are an excellent mode of transport (except when traveling very far up north which is out-of-reach by both trains and cars). The best way to describe Finnish trains? Incredibly comfortable and people-friendly, even in second class. First class (called Business Class) is not offered on all trains but when it is, it’s a real treat. On some trains, a self-service bar for snacks and drinks is provided, and there’s a dining car that offers tasty local and international cuisine on long distance services. Sleeping cars feature on-board showers, with private showers for the most luxurious cabins, shared showers for the least expensive. There are even special compartments for travelers with allergies. Ever the road warrior? Not to worry as cell phone coverage is superb on most trains. But why not simply chill and accept that warm, fuzzy feeling setting in. And, sit back and enjoy the stunning views of the blue lakes and green forests.""  Wow. I would say the MBTA experience is the antithesis of this. Bottom line: we need to spend the money on our transportation infrastructure. This is a number one priority. I think the money for this should come from big industry and currently tax-exempt universities that employ most of Boston's citizens. These large institutions are a primary reason for the need for mass transit in the first place and they should pay a large chunk of the bill for Boston's infrastructure.

The combination of numerous rotaries, poorly maintained crosswalks, poorly maintained bridge, and decrepit land use has made a very short ""as the crow flies"" distance from Sweetser Circle to Sullivan Square is a nightmarish hellhole for the pedestrian or bicyclist. Also, let's be honest here-- buses are garbage.  The MBTA bus options (104, 105, 109) are a piece of crap- completely unreliable, non-existent, etc.   There are so many ways to improve this situation, especially when the Wynn Casino gets built in the coming years.

Meanwhile busses sit at both terminals and drive through without stopping.  Granted, delays happen. But when there is chronic dysfunction and public feedback has no impact (specific emails and calls to Transit Authority), the problem is the 'system' or lack of a system. I've spoken to terminal 'Inspector' supervisors who say that one problem is that they are often hamstrung by the schedulers who pull busses out from under their control.  Passengers who have paid for a transportation system are left without reliable transportation.

u-bowEadPDYL-MmVN5ooWLz,q-2sQSVFuORH-2kpvSohQGZ,"What I want to know is when Boston is going to live up to it's moto as a ""Walkable City"", and work to promote, ensure and demand high standards of actually achieving Walkability ALL year round.  Connectivity between pedestrian and bicycle paths and sidewalks and transit are paramount to promoting transportation independence for those who do not exclusively rely on automobiles to get around (whether it be due to choice or physical, economical circumstance).   This connectivity is precisely what promotes the type of recreational, employment, commercial and residential density that Boston is celebrated for and/ or is committed to furthering.  However, during this week the rhetoric around snow has bee firstly, ""well we just got to much snow to handle, sorry we cant manage it.  Which is then followed up with rhetoric that is consistently heavily weighed towards, ""don't exhert yourself shoveling"", ""be careful driving on the streets"".  And instead it should be a safety campaign that shows pedestrians walking in the street or children waiting in the street for a school bus with the emphatic statement of, ""it's all our responsibility to keep our residents safe, shovel your sidewalks"".  But instead, the city has loosely enforced policies that don't actually force property owners to make walkways, a public resource, safe to travel on.  I'll leave you with the point that transportation independence is a quality of life issue that impacts ability to travel to jobs, run errands, recreate, etc…  If you want to make Boston the World Class City that we like to promote ourselves as we would actually work to make travel by car feasible ALL year round.  Boston is not the vanguard of cities learning how to run municipal services during inclement weather.  Other cities with similar climate/ weather maintain connectivity even in the coldest/ snowiest of months.   By not holding residents to a high standard for keeping our sidewalks and multi use paths safe you are essentially sending the message that you don't actually take the safety of the elderly who may not be able to drive anymore, young people who don't have a license yet, the parents who has to travel with a stroller or small children, any individual who uses a mobility assistance device like a wheel chair, walker, cane, etc… seriously.     And if we are to become the City that we imagine ourselves to be, Go Boston 2030 will need to address municipal service management and policies geared specifically towards snow removal management for ALL modes of transportation.  Otherwise, and this week has been a perfect case in point,  you risk alienating a large part of the population who choose to live here because of the density, has no control over their transportation choices, or whom can't afford other options.

If yours have to expire, offer a donation box at the airport in the security line (Denver does this for change to aid homeless youth).  The pretty side of the Charlie ticket isn't how it goes into the machine to enter the station.  It's a simple thing, but user experience matters.  I love the tap and go cards other transit systems use.  It doesn't appear I can buy a long-lived plastic card at the station when I arrive at South Station...or if it is possible, it's not intuitive.  I do love walking in Boston and have used Hubway quite a bit at all hours of day and night from the Convention Center to Brookline and back, in all weather (except snow), so kudos for your continuing good work to make walking, biking, and transit a viable option for your business visitors.

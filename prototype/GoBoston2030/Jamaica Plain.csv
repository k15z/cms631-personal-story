Connectivity between pedestrian and bicycle paths and sidewalks and transit are paramount to promoting transportation independence for those who do not exclusively rely on automobiles to get around (whether it be due to choice or physical, economical circumstance).   This connectivity is precisely what promotes the type of recreational, employment, commercial and residential density that Boston is celebrated for and/ or is committed to furthering.  However, during this week the rhetoric around snow has bee firstly, ""well we just got to much snow to handle, sorry we cant manage it.  Which is then followed up with rhetoric that is consistently heavily weighed towards, ""don't exhert yourself shoveling"", ""be careful driving on the streets"".  And instead it should be a safety campaign that shows pedestrians walking in the street or children waiting in the street for a school bus with the emphatic statement of, ""it's all our responsibility to keep our residents safe, shovel your sidewalks"".  But instead, the city has loosely enforced policies that don't actually force property owners to make walkways, a public resource, safe to travel on.  I'll leave you with the point that transportation independence is a quality of life issue that impacts ability to travel to jobs, run errands, recreate, etc‰Û_  If you want to make Boston the World Class City that we like to promote ourselves as we would actually work to make travel by car feasible ALL year round.  Boston is not the vanguard of cities learning how to run municipal services during inclement weather.  Other cities with similar climate/ weather maintain connectivity even in the coldest/ snowiest of months.   By not holding residents to a high standard for keeping our sidewalks and multi use paths safe you are essentially sending the message that you don't actually take the safety of the elderly who may not be able to drive anymore, young people who don't have a license yet, the parents who has to travel with a stroller or small children, any individual who uses a mobility assistance device like a wheel chair, walker, cane, etc‰Û_ seriously.     And if we are to become the City that we imagine ourselves to be, Go Boston 2030 will need to address municipal service management and policies geared specifically towards snow removal management for ALL modes of transportation.  Otherwise, and this week has been a perfect case in point,  you risk alienating a large part of the population who choose to live here because of the density, has no control over their transportation choices, or whom can't afford other options.

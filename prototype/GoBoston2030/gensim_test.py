text = "Juan is a Texas transplant who has lived in Boston for 18 years and loves that he can live here without a car. He shared his evening commute from his job at a nonprofit in Harvard Square to his home in Fort Hill with Alice Brown, the project manager of Go Boston 2030. Here are his ideas and the story of his trip. Leaving Brattle Square and heading to the first stop on the #1 bus, Juan explains that he prefers the bus over the subway because he can take the bus from one end (Harvard Square) to the other (Dudley Square).  “It mostly guarantees that I will get a seat. My favorites are the ones at the very end on the left or right by the window. One time, I saw the seats already had people, and I just skipped the bus. I wanted the next one.” Juan likes to control the length and speed of his trip. “Sometimes, I walk all the way home or run home so I can get my exercise, but normally I take the bus. There’s always a fear that something is going to go wrong with the subway, and I’ll get stuck.  It feels more frustrating being underground.  If there’s lots of traffic and I can see it, then I’ll just get out at the next stop and walk.” It works the opposite in the morning though. “I just usually get on the train. It’s way faster.” There’s a bit of a wait for the #1 bus. Juan talks about how he likes the flexibility his job offers him and how it impacts his commute. “I usually work 10:00 to 6:00, mainly because I just like the idea of coming in a little later, but also because that’s when there’s less traffic.  I’m pretty sure if I tried to take the bus at 5:00 it would probably be a little crazy.” “Because I live near Dudley Square, I also have the option to take the #66,” Juan says, “but that’s never a good option. The #1 bus seems designed to get you from Harvard to Dudley. With the #66, it seems like those just happen to be the ends of the route, but it’s not logical to be taking that convoluted way to get there.  It’s really a route to take if you’re trying to get to Allston or from Allston to Brookline Village or Brookline Village to Mission Hill. Most people think of it in pieces.” Juan has one caveat: “during the snow storm, I realized that the #66 was the faster route. Everyone was trying to pack onto the Orange Line or into the #1 bus, and nobody ever thought of hopping on the 66. I got my favorite seat and it was relatively quick.” And on days when he decided to walk last winter, he recounts, “it was a big surprise, but I actually found it safe trying to walk. It was clear and there wasn’t much ice.” During the bus ride, Juan describes the decision to move from Texas to Boston. “I came here for school knowing that I wouldn’t need to drive. If at some point I have to learn to drive, I will. In Boston, I just don’t have to.” He goes on to point out that “it doesn’t deter me when I travel either. I chose to go to cities that have transit. They are more interesting and I wouldn’t want to rent a car.” Juan points out places where the bus tends to slow down and where he considers whether to get off and walk on bad days. Today, the bus moves through Central Square without much delay, and Juan returns to reflecting on his travels. “Now that I’ve gone to other cities, I notice how noisy the train is here. In San Francisco the train goes super fast and the only noise is a ‘whoosh.’ I like that in Boston you have a visitor pass that is unlimited for the amount of time you’re visiting and you can go anywhere for one price. You can’t do that in DC.” As the bus waits for many people to board through the front door, Juan shares that “in Seattle, you just scan your pass and get on through any door. They just trust people to pay. I’m not sure it would work here, but I find it interesting.” Juan had seen the question ads back in January and when he saw, “What if I never had to wait for the bus again?” he thought, “Yes! That’s my question!” Now he has a chance to talk about policy and reflect more on how he travels. “I do walk sometimes and part it is for the exercise, but part of the reason is because I worry. I like knowing that it’s going to take exactly an hour and a half. Even if that’s a long time, I get to enjoy the walk. I use Instagram a lot and I like taking pictures of the Harvard Bridge, but really it’s a fear of unreliable transportation that pushes me to walk.” On weekends though, walking is a choice. “I like to walk around. I’ve started to go to other parts of the city more. At first it was just to explore, and then I discovered Instagram. I’ll take a picture of something I like while I’m walking, and then I’ll look it up to see whether it’s on the National Registry of Historic Places so I can post more information. Based on where I’ve lived before, I always thought that Back Bay and the South End were ‘near’ and Dorchester was ‘far’ but that’s not true now that I’ve explored farther on foot.” In general, Juan is pretty positive about getting around Boston. “Everything is so close together. In other cities, the roads are twice as wide and I feel like I could get hit by a car. Here, I like that pedestrians generally have the right of way.” Although he sounds like a very nice pedestrian when he describes the way he gets around, he points out that “sometimes when there’s a walk signal, I force cars to wait instead of turning. If somebody ever honks at me, I think ‘honking will only slow me down’ and change my pace. I don’t deserve to be honked at when I’m the guy following the rules. Most of the time I feel really safe, but I know that I have to be vigilant.” Whether he’s running errands or serving as a medical interpreter at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, walking serves most of his needs. “I’m on call on weekends and so I take advantage of where I live. When I get paged it might be on the overnight shift, so I know that I can just walk instead of trying to find a bus and feels pretty safe.” Walking can be linked to trips too. One of the reasons that he likes to take the #1 bus is because it goes by Tropical Foods so he can stop there on his way home and then walk the rest of the way. “I really like their new store and all of their Central American pastries. Whenever I can, I make grocery shopping part of my regular travel. Sometimes I’ll swing by CVS on my lunch break to get what I need and put it in my backpack. Then it’s not a hassle to make time to run errands.” At Emerson, Juan wrote an article on the best bus routes for students. He has also figured out other hacks for improving his commute. When the #1 bus stops at the Mass. Ave. Orange Line station, he points out, “You can see the schedule from here. You see how it says it’s arriving? There were times when I would always check, and hop off the bus if it was less than 2 minutes.” Another time he missed the #1 bus by a few seconds at Dudley Station and he I was running late. “I hopped on the Silver Line and took it to Mass. Ave. so I could catch the #1 bus at that intersection.” Juan thinks that there’s a hierarchy to deciding which mode of transportation to take. “The best feeling is to be able to sit down, so the first option is to get a good seat. The second option is to just walk. The third option is just standing there.” Walking can be the best option regardless of the weather, but it’s all dependent on having the right footwear and that’s an investment. “It took years before I had the luxury to have all these different shoes. It took me a while to buy separate snow boots and rain shoes and to buy a nice umbrella.” He’s looking to buy his first home, and he’d love to live in East Boston, but he says “it’s basically an island. The Blue Line is the newest subway line, and it’s really reliable. If there were ever problems though, I couldn’t walk home.” Instead, he’s thinking that he’ll probably buy a place deeper into Roxbury. “I keep thinking about how the Silver Line could be extended so that it goes further down into Warren Street or Blue Hill Ave. There are several bus routes that go through there that seem pretty reliable, but it could be even better.”"

# The GoBoston Hackathon
We looked at the GoBoston 2030 dataset and were intrigued by some of the ideas proposed by Boston
residents, which ranged from heated streets to melt the snow to flying cars. Our audience is every
young entrepreneur and inventor in Boston, and our goal is to get them to join us at the GoBoston 
2030 Civil Engineering Hackathon where we will build the future together.
